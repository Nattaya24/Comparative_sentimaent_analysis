# A comparative study of sentiment analysis on product reviews using lexicon based and machine learning approaches
This repository will present how to implement the sentiment analysis of product reviews using a lexicon-based and machine learning approach. Regarding sentiment analysis, NLP is used to classify text problems. To find out which approaches work better, comparisons and analyses of each model will be provided. To demonstrate the process, Python is a programming language used for implementation.

## Introduction
Understanding a customer’s attitude and emotion toward products and services helps companies or organizations understand their satisfaction level, which is crucial in the decision-making process. With this understanding, organizations can anticipate the marketing direction or adapt their strategies to meet the customer’s needs. On the other hand, the increasing use of technology allows customers to have more engagement with brands by sharing opinions in the form of reviews. Meanwhile, the capability of artificial intelligence can help organizations analyze big data, especially unstructured text data, in order to find some meaningful insight.

Amazon, an e-commerce company, allows its users to rate a product, ranging from 1 to 5, and provide a text review summary of their experience with the product and service to their seller. Since the Amazon product review is very personal and subjective, it can be a very rich source of information on how people perceive services and products.

## Classification of Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis can be categorized based on technical approaches. Typically, there are two main techniques that can approach sentiment analysis or text classification problems. In this implementation, we will use these approach and compare the result of the predictions.

1. Lexicon-based Approach
- 1.1  SentiWordNet
- 1.2  VADER (NLTK)
- 1.3  TextBlob

2. Machine Learning Approach
- 2.1 Kmean(Unsupervised Learning)
- 2.2 Naïve Bayes (Supervised learning)
- 2.3 SVM (Supervised learning)
